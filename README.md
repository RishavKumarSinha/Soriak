# Soriak
Welcome to Soriak Repository, a Weather Application, created as part of my GDSC event 'Web Blitz 4.0' Project.

## Features

- **Intuitive UI:** A clean and user-friendly interface for seamless note management.
- **IN-Depth Analysis:** Highly detailed data provided regarding different weather parameters.

## Resources

- GDSC Workshop PowerPoint Presentations.
- Youtube Tutorials.

## Special Note ( 23:21    29/03/24 )

- This Application is not fully functional yet as I failed to succesfully link all the parameters to OpenWeatherMap API due, despite all my efforts and time given to this project.
- As of now, I have commented out all the JS files as submission deadline is near. I will continue working on this project in order to figure out the remainig bugs and hope to publish the final project here, once it is successfully completed.
